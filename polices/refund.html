    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At Bell Photographers, our goal is to make sure that every family and
      student is satisfied with their portraits. If you're not satisfied with
      your portraits, and a retake date is available at your school, Bell
      Photographers will retake your photo (Fall Only). All that you need to do
      is bring the portraits with you on retake day and return it to the
      photographer. If a retake date is not available at your school, you may
      request a refund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complete satisfaction is guaranteed with Bell Photographers. We will
      refund full payment if all portraits are returned within 10 days of
      receipt. Digital products such as Digital Downloads and Photo CDs are
      non-refundable. To receive the full refund, simply return the entire
      package to the address below:
